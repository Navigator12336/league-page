  <p>Founded in 2024, Coast to Coast Dynasty League began amongst a small group of friends.</p>
  <p>Some managers built immediate win-now teams, while others began the slow process of building a juggernaut dynasty team. A portion of the league prioritized youth and draft picks, the rest gravitated towards the steadfast value of veterans. While some managers fled from injuries and down years, others bought the dip and built for the future.</p>
  <p>In astounding commitment to building a dynasty franchise, many of the managers have begun to have kids and groom the next generation of managers to take over their teams. The mini managers are being heavily indoctrinated into the fantasy lifestyle and will be expected to take an active role as soon as they can succesfully type out a coherent trade offer.</p>
  <p>The Champion manager walks away with the ultimate prize of bragging rights and sending obnoxious texts to the rest of the league for the next year</p>
  <p>See you next season!</p>
